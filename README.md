# Arduino Beep Toy
Arduino firmware for playing various melodies. Project for CodeWeek workshop for children.

Library of melodies contains 4 melodies. Set the desired melody to play and upload sketch to Arduino Nano. Device then plays a melody and waits 5 seconds. Then melody is played again.

The device can be used as a toy, if mounted in a casing. We can hide a toy, and the child then locates it through listening.
